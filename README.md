Policies
========

This is to develop written code of conduct policies for U.S. Chapter of the International Assocation of Landscape Ecology ([US-IALE](www.usiale.org)). As you can see by the fork history, much of the text is from the Stumptown Syndicate's efforts, which are also based on other efforts. The 'Additional Resources' section below links directly to some of these other efforts.
