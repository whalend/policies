# US-IALE Code of Conduct

US-IALE meetings and online spaces are open to US-IALE members and those interested in landscape ecology. A primary goal of US-IALE is to be inclusive and encouraging of contributors with varied and diverse backgrounds as we foster and promote landscape ecology. US-IALE is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all participants, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in US-IALE meetings and/or the online community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. All participants including, but not limited to, attendees, speakers, volunteers, exhibitors, US-IALE staff, service providers, and others are expected to abide by this US-IALE Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct also applies to all US-IALE meeting-related events including those sponsored by organizations other than US-IALE but held in conjunction with US-IALE events, in public or private facilities.

We invite all those who participate in US-IALE to help us create and maintain a safe and positive community for everyone.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all participants/attendees/vendors/staff:

  * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
  * Avoid personal attacks directed toward other participants/attendess/vendors/staff. 
  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
  * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert US-IALE leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
  * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

  * Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
  * US-IALE staff (or their designee) or security may take any action deemed necessary and appropriate, up to and including immediate removal from meetings without warning or refund and/or permanent expulsion from US-IALE without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 7. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the US-IALE Executive Committee with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies. [LINK_TO_POLICY]

[NOTE: Every organization's governing policies should dictate how you handle warnings and expulsions of community members. It is strongly recommended that you mention those policies here or in Section 7 and that you include a mechanism for addressing grievances.]

## 8. Scope

We expect all US-IALE members/participants/attendees/vendors/staff and other guests to abide by this Code of Conduct in all US-IALE venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to US-IALE business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of US-IALE activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of US-IALE members.
